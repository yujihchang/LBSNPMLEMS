Description: This package implements the proposed methods from the paper 
    "Estimation and Variable Selection for Semiparametric Transformation Models with Length-Biased Survival Data" 
    by Yu and Cheng. It provides a nonparametric maximum likelihood estimator (NPMLE) under a full-likelihood framework, 
    and includes variable selection using an adaptive LASSO penalty for semiparametric transformation models with 
    length-biased survival data.
